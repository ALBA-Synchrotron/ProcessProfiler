ProcessProfiler, Tango Device Server

  

Developed by Sergi Rubio, ALBA Synchrotron

The server will use fandango.linos module to monitorize some OS processes. For each process detailed in the ProcessList property (e.g. notifd) the device will generate several dynamic attributes: * notifd_pid: * notifd_mem: * notifd_cpu: The Update() command will force the update of this variables. This device server will be used to monitorize notifd issues in several control machines and trigger Alarms/Archiving if needed. 

Static attributes:

 LoadAverage #CPUUsage
 MaxRss  #Maximum memory usage
 MaxRssProcess  #Process using the most memory
 
Dynamic attributes for each process in ProcessList:

 *nprocesses
 *nthreads
 *pids
 *cpu
 *mem
 *vmem
 *memRatio
 *kbpm #(memory increase per minute)


To measure system usage the device server has several dependencies:

 - fandango module must be in your PYTHONPATH:
 
     svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/tango-cs/code/share/fandango/trunk/fandango
     
 - ProcessProfiler relies on common Linux commands/files, these must be valid in your distribution and the server must have permissions to access it:
 
    ps syntax supported:   ps hax -o pid,nlwp,%cpu,%mem,rss,vsize,cmd
    
    proc files must exist:   /proc/pid/status 
    
    
Enjoy,
